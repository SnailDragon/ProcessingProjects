# ProcessingProjects
A repository of my new generative art projects created in processing

--Not including projects finished before Oct 1 2021--

## [_oldGeneratedArt](/_oldGeneratedArt/)
From before I was organized, if you can't find a project in the README it's probably here

## [Averaging Grid](/averagingGrid/)
A matrix of a normal int value (#000000 or 0) is seeded with a number of constants of a differing value (#FFFFFF or 255). Then the grid is averaged with each cell being the average of its neighbors. The constants can later be phased out.
* [Averaging Grid Single](/averagingGridSingle/) - a single constant in the middle of the canvas that is phased out. Video: https://youtu.be/BgDL5DJ-pjQ 
* Averaging Grid (Averaging Color Grid) - multiple constats in random locations on the screen that are phased out. Video: https://youtu.be/wLTSLwzzCjg 

## [Blue Sweep](/bluesweep/) 
A sweeping semi-transparent blue triangle that changes width and alternates with a black triangle. Video: https://youtu.be/JXxlWly6DBs 

## [Circles and Rings](/circlesAndRings/)
Circles are placed in random locations and rings are drawn around them until a ring will overlap another circle's ring or go off the screen. Video: https://youtu.be/tEbOOEOPkAg 
* [Circles and Rings Oscillating](/circlesAndRingsOscillating/) (Circles and Rings Changing) - instead of stopping when a ring overlaps or goes out of bound, the rings contract until the circle/ring is gone. Video: https://youtu.be/b-7gQeBZHBI 

## [Conquering Colors](/conqueringColors/) (Pulsing Colors)
Randomly spreads pixels out in a solid color and then expands them using the spreading pixel method until they cover the screen, then it randomly spreads another color and repeats. (Also the blue/red is an example of chromostereopsis - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromostereopsis). Video: https://youtu.be/7ugP48Gb2-c

## [CTD Drift From Center](/CTDDriftFromCenter/)
Variant of my [Random Connect The Dots](/randomConnectTheDots/) project - recycling version of Dots Out of Center. Video: https://youtu.be/P6eO3NCH-6U

## [Dancing Islands](/dancingIslands/)
[Spreading Pixels](/spreadingPixels/) but with too many pixels for any to win and only two colors green (the islands) and blue (the ocean). Video: https://youtu.be/jHJoBTvOhfI

## [Game of Life](/gameOfLife/)
Projects based on Conway's Game of Life and adding new rules and twists.
* Game of Life - basic rules
* Game of Life Overpop (Spreading Stripes) - basic rules but the grid is modified and updated after each modification. Video: https://youtu.be/-9KzASJ-6mA 

## [Genuary 2022](/Genuary2022/)
A month of generated art challenges ([genuary.art](http://genuary.art/)) - see README in folder

## [Laser Pointer (16000)](/laserPointer/)
A terminating line (16000 mini-segments) that reflects off the walls starting from the center. Video: https://youtu.be/jiLxZkUr6dA

## [Lissajous Curve](/lissajousCurves/)
Basic project is a lissajous curve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve) with the parametric --> x = A * sin(a*t+c) y = B * sin(b*t) (t = i) increasing the 'c' value. Video: https://youtu.be/8zjWcnMuFd0
* [Lissajous Curve 1 (2)](/lissajousCurvesOne/) manipulates the other variables as well. Video: https://youtu.be/Y7pMGQIZLps

## [More Wonky Orbits](/morewonkyorbits/)
Same as [Wonky Orbits](/wonkyorbits/) but with all of the circles circling with the path created by something like r = cos(0.5 * theta). Video: https://youtu.be/BJSpUPocrBo 

## [Orbits on Orbits](/orbitsonorbits/)
Base project for other orbit-themed projects. Honestly a mess. Video: none. 

## [Random Connnect The Dots](/randomConnectTheDots/)
A given number of dots are generated and then they are connected to their neighbors. Image generation concept for future videos.

[rCTDDrift](/rCTDDrift/) - a collection of very similar projects (all built on the [Random Connect The Dots](/randomConnectTheDots/) Project): 
* Dots Out of Center (video: https://youtu.be/MqKs8q3ZJv8 and https://youtu.be/okDCCyCUHP0)
* Connect The Dots Wisp (video: https://youtu.be/MvPGh1PcVJU)
* Drifting Connect The Dots (video: https://youtu.be/uCk78jwzZOs)
* Drifting To The Sides (video: https://youtu.be/NgFVnrh4aJc)
* Middle Line (Fast) (video: https://youtu.be/r49vz-vzrAE and https://youtu.be/ZZR0Wgvguno)
* Connect The Dots Bouncing ([CTDBouncing](/CTDBouncing/)) (video: https://youtu.be/7p-4mTSvXVM)

## [Rectangle Borders](/rectangleborders/)
Same as Circles and Rings but with rectangles of varying dimensions. Video: https://youtu.be/bfsLtpVNjuI 
* [Rectangle Borders Changing](/rectangleBordersChanging/) - Video: https://youtu.be/XlgWbKK2J9o

## [Ripples](/ripples/)
Ripples made from expanding dot circles that get deleted when they collect. Video: https://youtu.be/rqoi_fCQEmE

## [Snowing Build Up](/snowingBuildUp/)
Randomly generated snowflakes fall and build up at the bottom. Video: https://youtu.be/IY_xDrwEOgk

## [Spreading Pixels](/spreadingPixels/)
Randomly generated grid of colors, every frame it randomly selects 5 boxes that have different colors ajacent to them and expands their color to the 4 boxes on each side (no diagonal). Video: https://youtu.be/1FTefi0TnVY 

## [Star Trails](/startrails/)
Animation imitating the style produced when photos are taken of stars throughout the night using long exposures, rotating forever. Video: https://youtu.be/_aBD7zjS9sc 

## [Too Many Orbits](/toomanyorbits/)
Same as Wonky Orbits but with more circles orbiting each circle. Video: https://youtu.be/YoZxNnHlHOU and https://youtu.be/koUqfKm1EHA (with tracing enabled)

## [Vector Field](/vectorField/)
A vector field with each vector rotating at a speed based on where it is in the field. Video: https://youtu.be/t-w4YcIibU4

## [Wonky Orbits](/wonkyorbits/)
Circles circling circles with the center circle circling the path created by something like r = cos(.5 * theta). Video: https://youtu.be/K9ZYQq7PilY
